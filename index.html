          <p>Presented by <a href="http://www.essex.gov.uk/Pages/Default.aspx">Essex County Council</a> and <a href="http://cmspace.org">Chelmsford Makerspace</a>, Civic Camp is a volunteer-driven concept, using our collective talents to bring about real change. Set over a whole weekend and kindly hosted by <a href="http://www.anglia.ac.uk/ruskin/en/home.html">Anglia Ruskin University</a>, we aim to answer the question “How can technology and information help people with Learning Disabilities live life to the full?”</p>
