        <h3>Introduction to Civic Camp</h3>
          <p>Presented by <a href="http://www.essex.gov.uk/Pages/Default.aspx">Essex County Council</a> and <a href="http://cmspace.org">Chelmsford Makerspace</a>, Civic Camp is a volunteer-driven concept, using our collective talents to bring about real change. Set over a whole weekend and kindly hosted by <a href="http://www.anglia.ac.uk/ruskin/en/home.html">Anglia Ruskin University</a>, we aim to answer the question “How can technology and information help people with Learning Disabilities live life to the full?”</p>
		  
          <h4>Where does this take place?</h4>
          <p>Civic Camp will take place at <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Anglia+Ruskin+University+-+Business+School/@51.7404797,0.4723871,17z/data=!4m6!1m3!3m2!1s0x47d87074365895a9:0xd8a17c16e0e1f477!2sAnglia+Ruskin+University!3m1!1s0x0:0xea2708e4e871f215">Anglia Ruskin University's Business School</a> in the Lord Ashcroft building. It is less than ten minutues walk from Chelmsford train station and on the <a href="http://www.essexhighways.org/Transport-and-Roads/Getting-Around/Bus/Park-and-Ride/Chelmer-Valley-Park-and-Ride.aspx">Chelmer Valley Park and Ride</a> route. Nearby parking is also available.</p>

		 <h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration and examples</h2>
		 <p>Through conversations with the LD community, we've put together six specific problems and example projects. These are free to use as inspiration, as the foundation of your project or just to give you an idea of what the issues are. We will reveal a new one every day so follow <a href="https://twitter.com/hackessex">@HackEssex</a> to be notified when a new one is posted!</p>
		 <h4>Help people with Learning Disabilities get work and help employers see the individual, not the disability</h4>
		 <p>People with Learning Disabilities want to work. Sometimes it feels as though the barrier isn’t the individual’s ability to work, but rather potential employers’ misperceptions.  How can we show employers what people with Learning Disabilities can do, rather than focus on what they can’t?</p>
		 <h4>Create a Keep Safe app that can guide people to reliable and trustworthy locations in any given area when they are alarmed or anxious</h4>
		 <p>The ‘Keep Safe’ scheme runs across much of Essex – a bright yellow sticker in the window of a shop means that the shop and the staff are trained, able and willing to provide help, support and access to a telephone should someone feel unsafe when they are out and about.
How can we take the geographic data and map it, creating an online map of safe space to make a call across a town, city or county – helping people understand where they can go to call for help before they feel unsure?</p>
		 <h4>Develop a Keep Safe website that can help point people to advice and assistance</h4>
		 <p>Today www.keepsafeessex.org.uk is little more than a domain name.  We want to grow the website, providing a range of information that is accessible to all Keep Safe users.</p>
